  "readme": "# react-swipe\n\n## About This Fork\nThis is a fork of react-swipe 2.3.1 that:\n* Shows the result of server-side rendering obeying the startSlide index option.\n* Updated to use React 0.14.x\n\n### What? Why?\nThe original does not show the result of server-side rendering and the maintainers stated they were not interested in this behavior. I say, \"shows the result\" because the server-side rendered markup was there, it was just hidden.\n\n[Brad Birdsall](https://github.com/thebird)'s [Swipe.js](http://swipejs.com), as a [React](http://facebook.github.io/react) component.\n\nCheck out the [demo](https://jed.github.io/react-swipe/demo) from a mobile device (real or emulated).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install react-swipe\n```\n\n_Please notice that starting from version `2.1.0` component depends on React `0.13.x`, latest version which depends on React `0.12.x` is `2.0.11`._\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar React = require('react')\nvar ReactSwipe = require('react-swipe')\n\nvar Carousel = React.createClass({\n    render: function () {\n        return (\n            <ReactSwipe\n                continuous={false}\n            >\n                <div>'PANE 1'</div>\n                <div>'PANE 2'</div>\n                <div>'PANE 3'</div>\n            </ReactSwipe>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nReact.render(<Carousel />, document.body)\n```\n\n## Props\n\nProperties are duplicates of options from [Swipe.js config](https://github.com/thebird/Swipe#config-options) but there are additional ones:\n\n- **slideToIndex** Integer - set index position by Swipe's `.slide()` method on `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method. It's useful when you need to control `ReactSwipe` by custom next/prev buttons - just update component with new index (it wont be updated if index number is the same as previous one).\n\n- **shouldUpdate** Function, _arguments: nextProps {Object}_ - by default `<ReactSwipe />` component will rerender itself and children **only** if `slideToIndex` [property has changed](https://github.com/jed/react-swipe/blob/gh-pages/react-swipe.js#L65). But `shouldUpdate` prop allows to define a function and control rerendering of children on your own.\n\n---\n\n**MIT Licensed**\n",
